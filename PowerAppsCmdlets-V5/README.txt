# PowerShell support for PowerApps (preview)
With the preview launch of the PowerShell cmdlets for app creators and administrators, you can automate many of the monitoring and management tasks that are only possible manually today in [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com) or the [PowerApps Admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com).

## Installation
To run the PowerShell cmdlets for app creators, do the following:

1. Download the [PowerShell scripts file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2006349).

2. Unzip the file into a folder.

3. Open a PowerShell command window (as administrator) in that same folder.

4. Run the following one-time PowerShell command (this presumes you've never run PowerShell commands on the current machine):

    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
    ```

5. Import the necessary modules using the following commands:

    ```
    Import-Module .\Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell.psm1 -Force
    Import-Module .\Microsoft.PowerApps.PowerShell.psm1 -Force
    ```

6.  There is a [known issue](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Administering-PowerApps/Getting-errors-when-I-try-to-import-the-preview-powerapps/td-p/109036) today that may also require you to manually unblock the PowerShell files using the following command:

    ```
    dir . | Unblock-File
    ```
7. Before accessing any of the commands, provide your credentials using the following command. These credentials are refreshed for up to ~8 hours before you're required to sign in again to continue using the cmdlets.

    ```
    # This call will open a prompt to collect the credentials (AAD account & password) that will be used by the commands
    Add-PowerAppsAccount
    ```

    ```
    # Here is how you can pass in credentials (avoiding opening a prompt)
    $pass = ConvertTo-SecureString "password" -AsPlainText -Force
    Add-PowerAppsAccount -Username foo@bar.com -Password $pass
    ```


## PowerApps cmdlets for app creators (preview)

### Prerequisite
Users with a valid PowerApps license can perform the operations in these cmdlets, but they will only have access to the resources (for example, apps, flows, etc.) that have been created or shared with them.

## PowerApps cmdlets for administrators (preview)

### Prerequisite
To perform the administration operations in the admin cmdlets, you'll need the following:

* A paid PowerApps Plan 2 license or a PowerApps Plan 2 trial license. You can sign-up for a 30-day trial license at [http://web.powerapps.com/trial](http://web.powerapps.com/trial). Trial licenses can be renewed if they've expired.

* [Office 365 Global Administrator](https://support.office.com/article/assign-admin-roles-in-office-365-for-business-eac4d046-1afd-4f1a-85fc-8219c79e1504) or [Azure Active Directory Global Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal) permissions if you need to search through another userâ€™s resources. (Note that Environment Admins only have access to those environments and environment resources for which they have permissions.)
